.split() - is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.

.indexOf() - to search and retrieve instances of values within an array
remember 
    - that this will return -1 if the occurence is not found
    - this function is case senstive

    ex. var str = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
        var n = str.indexOf("e");

document.write( ) -used to directly write to the HTML page itself 

.charAt() - returns the character at the specified index in a string
var str = "HELLO WORLD";
var res = str.charAt(str.length-1); --> Return the last character of a string
The index of the last character is -1, the second last character is -2, and so on (See Example below).
The index of the last character is -1, the second last character is -2, and so on (See Example below).

Note: Don’t use “document.write” as it will delete the contents of your page including your Javascript. Use “document.querySelector” or “document.getElementById”, alongside either “innerHTML” or “textcontent”, to write to the DOM



important syntax

if/else statements

if (condition/variable){
    [then] function;
    [then] console;
    [then]wuteva;
} 
else OR else if (condition) {
    [then] function;
    [then] console;
    [then]wuteva;
};

for loop

for (var i = 0; i < arrayNAme.length; i++ ) {
    code between the brackets repeats each time the iterator is smaller than the condition ex:
    console.log( "I love" + arrayName[i]);

}
