    <div class="dotted"> 
        <p> Prince, or Prince Rogers Nelson, was born and raised in the unassuming
            town of Minneapolis, Minnesota on June 7th, 1958.  He was well known for 
            his eclectic style of music, virtuoso level of skill in his chosen mediums
            and flambouyant sense of style. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Prince developed an interest in music as a young child and wrote his first song 
            at the age of seven. He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records 
            at the age of 17, and released his debut album For You in 1978. His 1979 album 
            Prince went platinum, and his next three albums—Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), 
            and 1999 (1982)—continued his success, showcasing his prominently explicit lyrics and 
            blending of funk, dance, and rock music
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as the Revolution and 
            released Purple Rain, the soundtrack album to his film debut. It quickly 
            became his most critically and commercially successful release, spending 24 
            consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200[12] and selling over 20 million copies                 
            worldwide. After releasing the albums Around the World in a Day (1985) and Parade (1986), 
            The Revolution disbanded, and Prince released the double album Sign o' the Times (1987) 
            as a solo artist. He released three more solo albums before debuting 
            The New Power Generation band in 1991.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1993, while in a contractual dispute with Warner Bros., he changed his stage name to 
            an unpronounceable symbol (Logo. Hollow circle above downward arrow crossed with a curlicued 
            horn-shaped symbol and then a short bar), also known as the "Love Symbol", and began releasing 
            new albums at a faster rate to remove himself from contractual obligations. He released five 
            records between 1994 and 1996 before signing with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring 
            to himself as "Prince" again. He released 16 albums after that, including the platinum-selling 
            Musicology (2004). His final album, Hit n Run Phase Two, was first released on the Tidal streaming 
            service on December 2015. Five months later, at the age of 57, Prince died of an accidental fentanyl 
            overdose at his Paisley Park recording studio and home in Chanhassen, Minnesota.
